# GDPR/EDPB Legal Assistant - Additional Resources README

## Overview
This repository serves as a supplementary resource for the **GDPR/EDPB Legal Assistant** project, which is hosted on Hugging Face. The AI assistant is designed to support privacy professionals, legal experts, and Data Protection Officers (DPOs) in navigating the complexities of European data protection regulations, particularly the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the guidelines set forth by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).

You can access the main project here: [GDPR/EDPB Legal Assistant on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/arsiba/GDPR-EDPB-AI).

The assistant utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, combining document retrieval with generative answering to provide context-aware responses. It is trained on a comprehensive archive of EDPB documents, enabling users to quickly find relevant legal guidance without manually sifting through thousands of PDF files.

## Repository Contents
- **PDF Documents:** A complete archive of over 1,600 EDPB documents, including guidelines, decisions, and other relevant materials.
- **Scraping Scripts:** Automated scripts for downloading EDPB documents from official sources.
- **Preprocessing Scripts:** Tools for converting raw PDF documents into a format suitable for embedding and indexing.
